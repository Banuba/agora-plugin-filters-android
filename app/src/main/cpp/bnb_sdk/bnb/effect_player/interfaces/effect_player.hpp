/**
 * The EffectPlayer class provides ability to play AR effects on set of images or video.
 * <h2>Lifecycle</h2>
 * In order to support an application lifecycle EffectPlayer provides  special methods
 * to control it during application states like pause or losing focus.
 * <h3>Effect playback</h3>
 * Initial playback state of newly created Effect Player instance is `active`. With playback
 * control methods described below, the player can be launched/resumed or paused. State of effect
 * player becomes stopped/inactive at the moment of surface loss or by calling the
 * EffectPlayer::playback_stop method.
 * One can use next three methods to control effect playback:
 *   <br/> - `EffectPlayer.playback_play`. Switching to active state attempt. Possible from
 *   paused or stopped state and has no effect if effect playback is already active. Playback
 *   resumes from the position saved before `EffectPlayer.playbackPause` call.
 *   <br/> - `EffectPlayer.playback_pause`. Suspend current playback attempt. The recognizer thread
 *   is stopped and all the video textures and audio units playback is stopped as well. Effect
 *   player doesn't react on EffectPlayer::pushFrame calls in suspended state except
 *   asynchronous-inconsistent mode.
 *   <br/> - `EffectPlayer.playbackStop`. Switch to inactive state. In addition to pause clears
 *   recognizer's buffer. The next switch to active state will result in total rerun of active
 *   effect which means that it will be started from the very beginning.
 * <h2>Android usage example</h2>
 * If you want an application to be active on windowed mode and if the
 * focus is on another application you can switch EffectPlayer into active state when
 * `onStart` activity callback occurs and switch to paused when `onStop` occurs. Otherwise you
 * can suspend `EffectPlayer` on `onPause` and resume on `onResume` callback to make an
 * instance of the `EffectPlayer` inactive while activity losing focus.
 * <h2> Context/surface control</h2>
 * There are two methods that have to be used to ensure correct operating of the
 * EffectPlayer. Losing context without notifying the EffectPlayer
 * leads to application crash. Methods for context changes notification:
 *   <br/> - `EffectPlayer.surfaceCreated`
 *   <br/> - `EffectPlayer.surfaceDestroyed`
 * <h2> Multi-Threading performance and safety. Listeners.</h2>
 * EffectPlayer allows to call some of its methods from several threads (simultaneously) for convenience and increased performance.
 * This is allowed only during normal operation, all invocations from other threads MUST finish before
 * you start destroying the EffectPlayer instance.
 * Most methods belong to one of the two groups:
 *   <br/> - MUST be called from the "Main" (also "Render") thread ("Not Reentrant, Not Thread-safe")
 *   <br/> - MAY be called from "Any" thread. Most are "Thread-safe"
 * Listener callbacks can be called back from any thread.
 * Generally for best performance and responsiveness you'll have 3 threads:
 *   <br/> - Main(render) thread for drawing-related operations
 *   <br/> - "Camera" thread for handling and push()-ing frames into EffectPlayer
 *   <br/> - UI Thread for handling user interactions and other tasks
